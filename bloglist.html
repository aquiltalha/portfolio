       <h2>August 2023</h2>
       <p>India's Moon rover has taken first steps on the lunar surface a day after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the south pole. Chandrayaan-3's rover "ramped down" from the lander and "India took a walk on the Moon!", the space agency said. The Vikram lander successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening. With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.</p>

        <h2>August 2023</h2>
        <p>Air pollution is even more dangerous than previously thought, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned, as it slashes maximum safe levels of key pollutants such nitrogen dioxide. An estimated seven million people die prematurely each year from diseases linked to air pollution, the WHO says. Low- and middle-income countries suffer the most, because of their reliance on fossil fuels for economic development. The WHO puts air pollution on a par with smoking and unhealthy eating. It is urging its 194 member states to cut emissions and take action on climate change, ahead of the COP26 summit in November.</p>

        <h2>August 2023</h2>
        <p>Bilingual people, who have learned two languages side by side from early childhood, have been studied by scientists for decades. They are keen to understand how speaking two languages fluently affects people on a cognitive level. And with the advent of MRI technology, researchers are now able to see on a very visual level the differences between monolingual brains and bilingual brains. Everyoneâ€™s brain is made up of neurons, which have a cell body, and dendrites, which are the connections between neurons.</p>
